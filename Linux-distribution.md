# Linux Distributions

Linux distributions (distros) are different versions of Linux that package the Linux kernel with various software, system utilities, and package managers. Each distro is designed for different use cases, such as personal computing, server management, or security.

Here are some popular Linux distributions:

    Ubuntu – One of the most beginner-friendly distros, widely used for personal and server use. It has great community support.

    CentOS (discontinued, replaced by AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux) – Previously a popular choice for servers, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

    Debian – A very stable and reliable distro, often used as a base for other distros like Ubuntu.

    Fedora – A cutting-edge distro that introduces new features before they reach RHEL.

    Arch Linux – A lightweight, rolling-release distro for advanced users who like customization.

    Kali Linux – Designed for cybersecurity and penetration testing.

    Alpine Linux – A lightweight, security-focused distro often used in containers.
